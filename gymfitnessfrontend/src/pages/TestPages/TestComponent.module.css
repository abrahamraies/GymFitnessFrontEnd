/*
  TestComponent.module.css - Cleaned up after MUI refactor.
  Most styles are now handled by MUI components and sx props in TestComponent.tsx.
  This file is kept for any very specific, non-MUI overrides or complex selectors
  that might be needed in the future, but should ideally remain minimal.
*/

/*
  Removed styles:
  - .container (replaced by MUI Box and Container with sx props)
  - .title (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .subtitle (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .input (replaced by MUI TextField)
  - .button (replaced by MUI Button)
  - .button:hover (handled by MUI Button)
  - .button:disabled (handled by MUI Button)
  - .questionContainer (replaced by MUI Paper with sx props)
  - .questionText (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .options (replaced by MUI Stack)
  - .option (replaced by MUI Button with sx props)
  - .option:hover (handled by MUI Button)
  - .optionSelected (handled by MUI Button variant/sx props)
  - .navigation (replaced by MUI Box with sx props)
  - .finalMessage (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .progressBar (replaced by MUI LinearProgress)
  - .progressFill (handled by MUI LinearProgress)
  - Media queries related to the above elements.
*/

/*
  If any specific styling is still needed that cannot be achieved with sx props
  or MUI theme overrides, it can be added here. For example:
*/
/*
.customTestComponentSpecificClass {
  // Custom properties
}
*/
