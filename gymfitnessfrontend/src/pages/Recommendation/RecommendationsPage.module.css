/*
  RecommendationsPage.module.css - Cleaned up after MUI refactor.
  Most styles are now handled by MUI components and sx props in RecommendationsPage.tsx.
  This file is kept for any very specific, non-MUI overrides or complex selectors
  that might be needed in the future, but should ideally remain minimal.
*/

/*
  Removed styles:
  - .container (replaced by MUI Box and Container with sx props)
  - .header (replaced by MUI Box and Typography)
  - .title (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .subtitle (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .resourceList (replaced by MUI Grid)
  - .resourceItem (replaced by MUI Card/Paper)
  - .resourceItem:hover (handled by MUI Card/Paper sx props or default transitions)
  - .icon (icons are now part of Card content, styled via sx or directly)
  - .resourceTitle (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .resourceDescription (replaced by MUI Typography)
  - .resourceLink (replaced by MUI Link or Button)
  - .resourceLink:hover (handled by MUI Link/Button)
  - .resourceLink svg (handled by icon components and sx props)
  - .backButton (replaced by MUI Button)
  - .backButton:hover (handled by MUI Button)
  - .backButton svg (handled by Button startIcon)
  - .loader (replaced by MUI CircularProgress and Typography)
  - .error (replaced by MUI Box and Typography with color="error")
  - Media queries related to the above elements.
*/

/*
  If any specific styling is still needed that cannot be achieved with sx props
  or MUI theme overrides, it can be added here. For example:
*/
/*
.customRecommendationSpecificClass {
  // Custom properties
}
*/
